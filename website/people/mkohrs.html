        <p>
          I have been a tinkerer since I first got into my dad's workshop when I was in
          elementary school. I love to find out how things work and make improvements. 
          Couple that with a love for computers and technology and I am in my last semester 
          of the IT- Software Developer program at CVTC. I have had jobs in both the service
          industry and retail but hope to someday soon find a job in the technology sector.
